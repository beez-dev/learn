Core web vitals
    - LCP(Largest Content Paint)*
        - LCP measures when the largest content element (e.g. image/text block) in the
        viewport is rendered to the screen.
        This approximates when the main content of the page is
        visible to users

    - FID(First Input Delay)*
        - Time taken for first page load to when the page becomes responsive

    - INP (Interaction to Next Page)*
        - Measures FID for all lifecycle of the page

    - CLS(Cumulative Layout Shift)*
        - Measures unexpected layout shifts that occur in the lifecycle of the page
        - Time taken to load Largest image (contentful paint) in the first page
        - CLS error (While scrolling content replaced by another content)
        - This is important as layout shifts may deviate or designate incorrect behaviour to user interaction
        - To simulate different platform effects, the network can be throttled

    - SI (Speed Index)
        - 

    - TTI (Time to interactive)

    - TTFB (Time to first byte):
        - Time between the request for a resource and when the first byte of a response
            begins to arrive.
        - This may also affect a LCP

    - Total Blocking Time(TBT):
        - When you have a very heavy javascript file, that is not deferred or 
            does not load async, this is going to block the main thread




- Fundamentals to note:
    - Check if users are mostly desktop or mobile users

- Tricks for images:
    - HTML <picture> element contains one or more source
        elements each referring to different images through
        the srcset attribute
